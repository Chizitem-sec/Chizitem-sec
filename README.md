I’m currently pursuing my master’s degree in Cybersecurity at Washington University of Science and Technology (WUST). I have a strong interest in ethical hacking, problem-solving, and exploring how technology can be used to strengthen security systems. I enjoy taking on challenges that push me to think critically and creatively, especially when it comes to identifying vulnerabilities and building stronger defenses.
